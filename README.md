- **Project Name: CSC148 Assignment 2: Prefix Trees and Melodies**

**Introduction:**
This project explores the implementation of prefix trees and applies them to develop an autocompletion tool similar to Google search. The assignment tasks involve implementing the Autocompleter ADT supporting operations like insertion, autocompletion, and removal. Additionally, algorithms for unlimited and limited autocompletion based on weights are developed.

**Installation:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```
